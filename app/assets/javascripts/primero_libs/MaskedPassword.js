 MaskedPassword.js       Converts password fields into "masked" password fields

 Adapted from https://www.sitepoint.com/better-passwords-1-the-masked-password-field/
 Source code http://www.sitepoint.com/examples/password/MaskedPassword.zip

 Beside the organization on via prototype, the code is pretty much the same.

 We changed the fact that is supposed to act like when the user introduce a password
 on the mobile, which after some time masked the last character; changed to always
 masked and no one could see the password.

 Also change some of the event chain to use jquery.

 Introduced the method "val" to get/set the value via javascript code.

 Introduced the new class User MaskedUser because we need to avoid the browser
 display the dropdown of users, that will not mask the user input, but will it
 copy to a hidden field which is the one that the form will send.
