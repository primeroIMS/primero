          add_note:
            explanation: Allows a user to add an entry into the "Notes" subform (also
              sometimes called "Comments"). The user does this by clicking the "Add
              Notes" button onthe case show page. This action is particularly useful
              for managers who do not have the ability to edit cases, but want to
              add reminders to a case for the case worker. In this way, adding a note
              is similar to adding a flag. The advantage of adding a note is that,
              when the manager adds a note to a case, a notification will appear on
              the case for the case worker when they are viewing the case on their
              mobile device.

          display_view_page:
            explanation: If a user performs a search for a case to which they do not
              have access, this permission allows them to see a small modal with basic
              information about the case, even if the user cannot click into the case
              to see all of its information. The fields which appear in this "View
              Modal" are fields which have been configured to "Show on Short Form."
              This modal is also useful for users performing Family Tracing and Reunification
              actions, since the "View Modal" is available for the user to access
              when they are reviewing cases which have appeared as "Potential Matches"
              for a Tracing Request.
            label: Display View Page
          enable_disable_record:
            explanation: Ability to disable or enable a case. "Disabled" cases do
              not appear by default in the case list. Users can see disabled cases
              in the case list by using a filter. Since Primero does not allow users
              to delete cases, a user may wish to disable a case as a substitute.
              For instance, if a user created a case by mistake, or the case has bad
              data, the user should disable it.
            label: Enable / Disable
          export_case_pdf:

              case show pages, which contains all fields to which the current user
              has access, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access.
              In the PDF export file, information is listed first by case, and then
              further organized by the form on which information appears.
            label: Export case PDF
          export_csv:

              one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access. In this export,
              each form is represented in its own tab within the XLS file. The user
              can select which forms or fields they want included in the export using
              the Custom Export modal. Please note that users can only include forms
              and fields in the export if they already have the ability to see those
              forms and fields when viewing a case in the application.
            label: Export custom
          export_duplicate_id_csv:
            explanation: Creates a CSV export of cases which have the same National
              ID field (may have a different label, depending on the configuration).
              Only performed from case list page.
            label: Export duplicates
          export_json:
            explanation: User can generate a JSON file export from the case list or
              case show pages, which contains all fields to which the current user
              has access, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access.
              This export is mainly used for those who want to export cases from the
              current Primero system and then import them into a different Primero
              system, or into another information management system. The JSON format
              is machine-readable and not practical for most users.
            label: Export JSON
          export_list_view_csv:
            explanation: User can generate a CSV file export from the case list page
              which contains the same fields which appear for that user on the case
              list. Only performed from the case list page.
            label: Export list view CSV
          export_pdf:
            explanation: User can generate a PDF file export from the case list or
              case show pages, which contains all fields to which the current user
              has access, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access.
              In the PDF export file, information is listed first by case, and then
              further organized by the form on which information appears.
            label: Export case PDF
          export_photowall:
            explanation: Allows the user to export a file from the case list page
              which contains the photos of all cases selected. This export is mainly
              used for Family Tracing and Reunification activities. Only performed
              from case list page.
            label: Export Photowall
          export_unhcr_csv:
            label: Export UNHCR CSV
          export_xls:
            explanation: 'User can generate a XLS file export from the case list or
              case show pages, which contains all fields to which the current user
              has access, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access.
              In this export, each form is represented in its own tab within the XLS
              file. NOTE: The XLS format renders non-Latin characters (e.g. Arabic,
              Bangla) in a readable format, while the CSV export does not.'
            label: Excel (XLS file) export
          find_tracing_match:
            explanation: This is used exclusively for contexts with Family Tracing
              and Reunification activity. Users with this permission will see a "Find
              Tracing Match" button on the case show page. When they click it, they
              will arrive at a list of tracing requests in the system which are potential
              matches for their case.
            label: Find tracing match from case
          flag:
            explanation: Ability to add a flag to a case. Users with this permission
              can also remove the flags that they have added to a case.
            label: Flag
          import:
            explanation: Allows the user to create one or more new cases by importing
              them from a CSV, Excel, or JSON file. The imported file must be formatted
              *very* specifically for information to be imported properly. This function
              should only be available for administrative users with advanced technical
              skills and an in-depth knowledge of how data is formatted in Primero.
              Only performed from case list page.
            label: Import
          incident_details_from_case:
            explanation: Ability to add an entry for the Incident Details subform
              on a case you have found in search results, but to which you do not
              have access. The user performs this action from the search results page
              by selecting one or more cases, then selecting "Add Incident" from the
              actions menu. The user then sees a modal containing all the fields on
              the Incident Details subform, where they can enter and submit information
              about a service. Because this action can only be performed from the
              search results page, it only makes sense for a role to have this permission
              if they also have the "Search for case records owned by other users"
              permission.
            label: Add Incident Details to another user's case from search results
              page
          incident_from_case:
            explanation: This permission allows the user to click the "Create Incident"
              button. This generates an incident which may contain some information
              copied over from the case. For GBV cases, this button is at the top
              of the show case page, and corresponds to information about the case
              as a whole. In some incident-tracking contexts, this button is on an
              "Incident Details" subform. In this situation, some information may
              be copied from the incident details subform where the button was clicked,
              as well as from the case as a whole. I.e. the new incident created may
              contain the field "Type of Violence" from the individual incident details
              subform, but may also contain the age and sex of the case itself. Note
              that this permission also allows the user to see a link to the incident
              which was created.
            label: Create an incident from a case
          manage:
            explanation: Allows a user to perform all available actions on cases.
              The "Manage" permission essentially means "everything".
            label: Manage (all permissions for this resource type)
          read:
            explanation: Ability to view a case
            label: View
          receive_referral:
            explanation: Allows a user to receive a referral. Users with this permission
              will appear as potential recipients of a referral action, while users
              without this permission, will not appear as potential recipients when
              someone is looking for a recipient in the referral modal.
            label: Receive Referral
          receive_referral_different_module:
            explanation: Allows a user to receive a referral of a record that is created
              in a different Primero module. Users with this permission will appear as
              potential recipients of a referral action for that record,
              while users without this permission, will not appear as potential recipients
              when someone is looking for a recipient in the referral modal.
            label: Receive Referral from a user in a different module
          receive_transfer:
            explanation: Allows a user to receive a transfer. Users with this permission
              will appear as potential recipients of a transfer action, while users
              without this permission, will not appear as potential recipients when
              someone is looking for a recipient in the transfer modal.
            label: Receive Transfer
          referral:
            explanation: Allows a user to temporarily give access to a case to another
              user. The recipient of the referral will be able to perform all the
              same actions on the referred case as they would be able to perform on
              their own cases. When the recipient no longer needs access to the case,
              they can click the "Done" button in the Referrals and Transfers subform,
              and they will lose access to the case. You can only refer a case to
              a user whose role has the ability to receive referrals.
            label: Referral
          referral_from_service:
            explanation: Allows the user to see the "Refer" button on the Services
              subform. When the user clicks this button, the referral modal will appear
              with the Service Type, Agency, Service Provider, and Location fields
              disabled, but automatically filled with the information for those fields
              in the Services subform on which the user clicked the Refer button.
            label: Refer Case from Service subform
          remove_assigned_users:
            explanation: Allows the user to remove other users from the "Other Assigned
              Users" field. A user is listed here if they have received a referral
              for the case or have received a transfer for the case, but have not
              yet accepted or rejected it. When you remove a user from the "Other
              Assigned Users" field, you remove their access to the case. So, users
              with this permission can remove case access from users who have previously
              received referrals or still-pending transfers for the case. Note that
              this permission only works if the current user also has the ability
              to edit the case.
            label: Remove other assigned users (taking back case access from referred-to
              users)
          reopen:
            explanation: Allows a user to open a case which is currently closed.
            label: Reopen
          request_approval_action_plan:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_assessment:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_bia:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_case_plan:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_closure:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_gbv_closure:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_transfer:
            explanation: Reveals the "Request Transfer" button on the "View Modal".
              The button allows the user to send a message with a personalized note
              via email to the current record owner of a case, requesting that the
              record owner transfer the case to the user who sent the request. This
              is useful in contexts where children change locations often, and case
              workers need a child's previous case worker to send information about
              the child to avoid the creation of a duplicate record.
            label: Request Transfer
          search_owned_by_others:
            explanation: Allows a user to perform a search for records which they
              would not usually have access to, either because they are not the record
              owner for that case, or (for managers) because the record owner is not
              in their user groups. Note that, while the user will see the case in
              the search results view, they will not be able to click into the case
              show page for that case, meaning they will not be able to see any detailed
              information about the case.
            label: Search for case records owned by other users
          service_provision_incident_details:
            explanation: Allows the user to see a button labelled "Save and Add Service
              Provision" at the bottom of the Add Incident modal. Clicking this button
              saves the information currently entered about the incident, and then
              takes the user directly to the Add Service Provision modal. Because
              this action is directly linked to the Add Incident and Add Service Provision
              actions, it only makes sense to give this permission to a role if that
              role also has the "Add Incident Details to another user's case" and
              "Add Service provision to another user's case" permissions.
            label: See Add Service Provision Button on Incident Details Modal
          services_section_from_case:
            explanation: Ability to add an entry for of the Services subform on a
              case you have found in search results, but to which you do not have
              access. The user performs this action from the search results page by
              selecting one or more cases, then selecting "Add Service Provision"
              from the actions menu. The user then sees a modal containing all the
              fields on the Services subform, where they can enter and submit information
              about a service. Because this action can only be performed from the
              search results page, it only makes sense for a role to have this permission
              if they also have the "Search for case records owned by other users"
              permission.
            label: Add Service provision to another user's case
          sync_external:
            explanation: Ability to sync a Record with an external information management system
            label: Sync with an external information management system
          sync_mobile:
            explanation: This permission generally allows the user to use the mobile
              application. First, it allows the user to see the "Mark for Mobile"
              and "Un-mark for Mobile" actions, which appear on the case list and
              case show pages. Marking a case for mobile indicates that information
              about that case should be synced between the user's mobile device and
              the web application, while un-marking a case for mobile stops this syncing
              from happening. Users without this permission also cannot sync their
              mobile devices with the web application in general, meaning that they
              cannot use the mobile app to manage cases.
            label: Sync with mobile device
          transfer:
            explanation: Allows a user to send a case from its current record owner
              to any user in the system with the ability to receive transfers. The
              record owner of the case does not change, however, until the recipient
              of the transfer "accepts" it. If the recipient instead "rejects" the
              transfer, the recipient loses access to the case, and it keeps its original
              record owner.
            label: Transfer
          view_photo:
            explanation: Allows a user to see a case's photos from the case list view.
              Without this permission, the user does not see the "Photo" column of
              the case list table, or the photo icons which appear there. This permission
              also allows the user to see photos of the child in the "View Modal".
            label: View Photo from case list view
          view_incident_from_case:
            explanation: “When viewing a Case, User can see a list of Incidents linked

            label: View Incidents from Case
          view_protection_concerns_filter:
            explanation: Allows the user to see a protection concerns filter on the

          accept_or_reject_transfer:
            explanation: Allows the user to accept or reject a transfer on behalf of
              another user who is on your team (for example, a supervisor accepting a
              transfer which has been sent to their social worker).
            label: Accept or reject transfer for another user on your team.
          list_case_names:
            explanation: Managers usually cannot see the names of Cases in the Case List.
              If a manager has this permission, they will be able to see names in the list.

          dash_tasks:
            explanation: Allows the user to see the tasks page. This should be used
              for case workers and service providers, since the numbers will be specifically
              for the cases you manage directly. Managers should instead get the "View
              Cases By Task Overdue" dashboard, since this lets them see the overdue
              tasks for everyone in their user groups.

          sync_mobile:
            explanation: This permission generally allows the user to use the mobile
              application. First, it allows the user to see the "Mark for Mobile"
              and "Un-mark for Mobile" actions, which appear on the incident list
              and incident show pages. Marking an incident for mobile indicates that
              information about that incident should be synced between the user's
              mobile device and the web application, while un-marking an incident
              for mobile stops this syncing from happening. Users without this permission
              also cannot sync their mobile devices with the web application in general,
              meaning that they cannot use the mobile app to manage incidents.
            label: Sync with mobile device

              fields, and lookups. Please note that a user with this permission will
              only be able to manage forms which they have access to. For instance,
              if a national administrator only has the ability to see the Record Owner

      referral:
        actions:
          refer:
            explanation: This means the role will appear as an option for "Type of
              Recipient" when the user performs an external referral. If the user
              chooses this role as the type of referral, the export which Primero
              generates when the user submits the referral will only contain information
              which is found in the forms this role has access to. So, for instance,
              if the user chooses "Medical Service Provider" as the type of recipient,
              and the Medical Service Provider role only has access to the Basic Identity
              and Protection Concerns forms, the export file which Primero exports
              for the external referral will only contain the fields which are in

              or agency administrators looking to gain insights into their own teams'
              or organization's performance. This permission also gives the user the

            explanation: Ability to select a role when creating or editing a user
              account. This permission is necessary for any role which will be creating
              or editing user accounts.

            explanation: Ability to create a copy of a role. This is useful for system
              administrators who may be creating a number of roles which are extremely
              similar to each other (e.g. service providers).

          permitted_roles:
            explanation: If a role has the ability to perform any of the above actions
              on a role, they will be able to perform those actions on the roles specified
              in this list. So, for instance, if a role has the "Read" and "Assign"
              permission on roles, but only has "CP Case Worker" and "CP Manager"
              listed as its "Managed Roles", it will only be able to see those two
              roles, and will only be able to assign new users to those two roles.
              If the same role has no "Managed Roles" specified, it will be able to
              see all roles and will be able to create new user accounts with any
              role in the system.

              the current user has access, for one, multiple, or all records to which
              the user has access. In the PDF export file, information is listed first

              appears.

              or fields, for one, multiple, or all tracing request to which the user
              has access. In this export, each form is represented in its own tab
              within the XLS file. The user can select which forms or fields they
              want included in the export using the Custom Export modal. Please note
              that users can only include forms and fields in the export if they already
              have the ability to see those forms and fields when viewing a tracing
              request in the application.

              the current user has access, for one, multiple, or all tracing requests
              to which the user has access. This export is mainly used for those who
              want to export tracing requests from the current Primero system and
              then import them into a different Primero system, or into another information
              management system. The JSON format is machine-readable and not practical
              for most users.

              *very* specifically for information to be imported properly. This function
              should only be available for administrative users with advanced technical
              skills and an in-depth knowledge of how data is formatted in Primero.

        label: Tracing Request
      transfer:
        actions:
          transfer:
            explanation: This means the role will appear as an option for "Type of
              Recipient" when the user performs an external referral. If the user
              chooses this role as the type of transfer, the export which Primero
              generates when the user submits the transfer will only contain information
              which is found in the forms this role has access to. So, for instance,
              if the user chooses "Medical Service Provider" as the type of recipient,
              and the Medical Service Provider role only has access to the Basic Identity
              and Protection Concerns forms, the export file which Primero exports
              for the external transfer will only contain the fields which are in
              those two forms.

        label: Transfer
      user:
        actions:
          agency_read:
            explanation: Ability to see only those user accounts in the current user's
              agency. This also affects which user accounts the current user can perform
              other actions on. For instance, if the current user has the "Write"
              permission on users, but also has the Agency Read permission, they will
              only be able to edit user accounts which are in their own agency. Similarly,
              if the current user has the "Manage" permission on users, but has the
              "Agency Read" permission, they will only be able to create users for
              their own agency.

            label: Manage (all permissions for this resource type)
          read:
            explanation: Ability to see user accounts. By default, every user has
              the ability to see and edit information about their own user account
              (e.g. password, email).
            label: View
          write:
            explanation: Ability to click the "Edit" button on the show user page,
              update information about the user, and then save. Please note that this

            explanation: Ability to pick user groups when creating or editing a user
              account. Please note that if the current user has the "only records
              or users in my group" level of access, they will only be able to select
              one or more of *their own* user groups for the user account that they
              are creating or editing. This means that a manager with the ability
              to assign user groups would only be able to add a user to user groups
              the manager currently belongs to. This permission is necessary for any
              role which will be creating or editing user accounts.
