          add_note:
            explanation: Allows a user to add an entry into the "Notes" subform (also
              sometimes called "Comments"). The user does this by clicking the "Add
              Notes" button onthe case show page. This action is particularly useful
              for managers who do not have the ability to edit cases, but want to
              add reminders to a case for the case worker. In this way, adding a note
              is similar to adding a flag. The advantage of adding a note is that,
              when the manager adds a note to a case, a notification will appear on
              the case for the case worker when they are viewing the case on their
              mobile device.

          display_view_page:
            explanation: If a user performs a search for a case to which they do not
              have access, this permission allows them to see a small modal with basic
              information about the case, even if the user cannot click into the case
              to see all of its information. The fields which appear in this "View
              Modal" are fields which have been configured to "Show on Short Form."
              This modal is also useful for users performing Family Tracing and Reunification
              actions, since the "View Modal" is available for the user to access
              when they are reviewing cases which have appeared as "Potential Matches"
              for a Tracing Request.
            label: Display View Page
          enable_disable_record:
            explanation: Ability to disable or enable a case. "Disabled" cases do
              not appear by default in the case list. Users can see disabled cases
              in the case list by using a filter. Since Primero does not allow users
              to delete cases, a user may wish to disable a case as a substitute.
              For instance, if a user created a case by mistake, or the case has bad
              data, the user should disable it.

              can select which forms or fields they want included in the export using
              the Custom Export modal. Please note that users can only include forms
              and fields in the export if they already have the ability to see those

              *very* specifically for information to be imported properly. This function
              should only be available for administrative users with advanced technical
              skills and an in-depth knowledge of how data is formatted in Primero.
              Only performed from case list page.
            label: Import
          incident_details_from_case:
            explanation: Ability to add an entry for the Incident Details subform
              on a case you have found in search results, but to which you do not
              have access. The user performs this action from the search results page
              by selecting one or more cases, then selecting "Add Incident" from the
              actions menu. The user then sees a modal containing all the fields on
              the Incident Details subform, where they can enter and submit information
              about a service. Because this action can only be performed from the
              search results page, it only makes sense for a role to have this permission
              if they also have the "Search for case records owned by other users"
              permission.
            label: Add Incident Details to another user's case from search results
              page
          incident_from_case:
            explanation: This permission allows the user to click the "Create Incident"
              button. This generates an incident which may contain some information
              copied over from the case. For GBV cases, this button is at the top
              of the show case page, and corresponds to information about the case
              as a whole. In some incident-tracking contexts, this button is on an
              "Incident Details" subform. In this situation, some information may
              be copied from the incident details subform where the button was clicked,
              as well as from the case as a whole. I.e. the new incident created may
              contain the field "Type of Violence" from the individual incident details
              subform, but may also contain the age and sex of the case itself. Note
              that this permission also allows the user to see a link to the incident
              which was created.
            label: Create an incident from a case
          remove_alert:
            explanation: This permission allows the user to remove an alert from
              a case. Alerts are typically generated when a particular field is
              edited, such as when notes are updated. Alerts are usually shown
              with a yellow dot next to the case.
            label: Remove alert from a case
          manage:
            explanation: Allows a user to perform all available actions on cases.
              The "Manage" permission essentially means "everything".
            label: Manage (all permissions for this resource type)

            explanation: Ability to view a case
            label: View
          receive_referral:
            explanation: Allows a user to receive a referral. Users with this permission
              will appear as potential recipients of a referral action, while users
              without this permission, will not appear as potential recipients when
              someone is looking for a recipient in the referral modal.
            label: Receive Referral
          receive_referral_different_module:
            explanation: Allows a user to receive a referral of a record that is created
              in a different Primero module. Users with this permission will appear as
              potential recipients of a referral action for that record,
              while users without this permission, will not appear as potential recipients
              when someone is looking for a recipient in the referral modal.
            label: Receive Referral from a user in a different module
          receive_transfer:
            explanation: Allows a user to receive a transfer. Users with this permission
              will appear as potential recipients of a transfer action, while users
              without this permission, will not appear as potential recipients when
              someone is looking for a recipient in the transfer modal.
            label: Receive Transfer
          referral:
            explanation: Allows a user to temporarily give access to a case to another
              user. The recipient of the referral will be able to perform all the
              same actions on the referred case as they would be able to perform on
              their own cases. When the recipient no longer needs access to the case,
              they can click the "Done" button in the Referrals and Transfers subform,
              and they will lose access to the case. You can only refer a case to
              a user whose role has the ability to receive referrals.
            label: Referral
          referral_from_service:
            explanation: Allows the user to see the "Refer" button on the Services
              subform. When the user clicks this button, the referral modal will appear
              with the Service Type, Agency, Service Provider, and Location fields
              disabled, but automatically filled with the information for those fields
              in the Services subform on which the user clicked the Refer button.
            label: Refer Case from Service subform
          remove_assigned_users:
            explanation: Allows the user to remove other users from the "Other Assigned
              Users" field. A user is listed here if they have received a referral
              for the case or have received a transfer for the case, but have not
              yet accepted or rejected it. When you remove a user from the "Other
              Assigned Users" field, you remove their access to the case. So, users
              with this permission can remove case access from users who have previously
              received referrals or still-pending transfers for the case. Note that
              this permission only works if the current user also has the ability
              to edit the case.
            label: Remove other assigned users (taking back case access from referred-to
              users)
          reopen:
            explanation: Allows a user to open a case which is currently closed.
            label: Reopen
          request_approval_action_plan:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_assessment:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_bia:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_case_plan:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_closure:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_approval_gbv_closure:
            explanation: Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their
              manager approve their case's %{approval_label}.
            label: Request %{approval_label} approval
          request_transfer:
            explanation: Reveals the "Request Transfer" button on the "View Modal".
              The button allows the user to send a message with a personalized note
              via email to the current record owner of a case, requesting that the
              record owner transfer the case to the user who sent the request. This
              is useful in contexts where children change locations often, and case
              workers need a child's previous case worker to send information about
              the child to avoid the creation of a duplicate record.
            label: Request Transfer
          search_owned_by_others:
            explanation: Allows a user to perform a search for records which they
              would not usually have access to, either because they are not the record
              owner for that case, or (for managers) because the record owner is not
              in their user groups. Note that, while the user will see the case in
              the search results view, they will not be able to click into the case
              show page for that case, meaning they will not be able to see any detailed
              information about the case.
            label: Search for case records owned by other users
          service_provision_incident_details:
            explanation: Allows the user to see a button labelled "Save and Add Service
              Provision" at the bottom of the Add Incident modal. Clicking this button
              saves the information currently entered about the incident, and then
              takes the user directly to the Add Service Provision modal. Because
              this action is directly linked to the Add Incident and Add Service Provision
              actions, it only makes sense to give this permission to a role if that
              role also has the "Add Incident Details to another user's case" and
              "Add Service provision to another user's case" permissions.
            label: See Add Service Provision Button on Incident Details Modal
          services_section_from_case:
            explanation: Ability to add an entry for of the Services subform on a
              case you have found in search results, but to which you do not have
              access. The user performs this action from the search results page by
              selecting one or more cases, then selecting "Add Service Provision"
              from the actions menu. The user then sees a modal containing all the
              fields on the Services subform, where they can enter and submit information
              about a service. Because this action can only be performed from the
              search results page, it only makes sense for a role to have this permission
              if they also have the "Search for case records owned by other users"
              permission.
            label: Add Service provision to another user's case
          service_own_entries_only:
            explanation: Users with this permission, when accessing a Case which has been referred to them,
              will see only entries in the Services subform for which they have been selected as the service provider.
              This is typically used for Service Provider roles.
            label: Access only my own Services subform entries

            label: Mark for Offline
          transfer:
            explanation: Allows a user to send a case from its current record owner
              to any user in the system with the ability to receive transfers. The
              record owner of the case does not change, however, until the recipient
              of the transfer "accepts" it. If the recipient instead "rejects" the
              transfer, the recipient loses access to the case, and it keeps its original
              record owner.
            label: Transfer
          view_photo:
            explanation: Allows a user to see a case's photos from the case list view.
              Without this permission, the user does not see the "Photo" column of
              the case list table, or the photo icons which appear there. This permission
              also allows the user to see photos of the child in the "View Modal".
            label: View Photo from case list view
          view_incident_from_case:
            explanation: “When viewing a Case, User can see a list of Incidents linked
              to the Case, along with some summary information about each.
            label: View Incidents from Case
          view_protection_concerns_filter:

            label: Edit
          accept_or_reject_transfer:
            explanation: Allows the user to accept or reject a transfer on behalf of
              another user who is on your team (for example, a supervisor accepting a
              transfer which has been sent to their social worker).
            label: Accept or reject transfer for another user on your team.
          list_case_names:
            explanation: Managers usually cannot see the names of Cases in the Case List.
              If a manager has this permission, they will be able to see names in the list.
            label: If manager, can see Case names on Case List.

              information about that incident should be synced between the user's
              mobile device and the web application, while un-marking an incident
              for mobile stops this syncing from happening. Users without this permission
              also cannot sync their mobile devices with the web application in general,

              generates when the user submits the referral will only contain information
              which is found in the forms this role has access to. So, for instance,
              if the user chooses "Medical Service Provider" as the type of recipient,
              and the Medical Service Provider role only has access to the Basic Identity
              and Protection Concerns forms, the export file which Primero exports

              the current user has access, for one, multiple, or all records to which
              the user has access. In the PDF export file, information is listed first

              or fields, for one, multiple, or all tracing request to which the user
              has access. In this export, each form is represented in its own tab
              within the XLS file. The user can select which forms or fields they
              want included in the export using the Custom Export modal. Please note
              that users can only include forms and fields in the export if they already
              have the ability to see those forms and fields when viewing a tracing
              request in the application.

              want to export tracing requests from the current Primero system and
              then import them into a different Primero system, or into another information
              management system. The JSON format is machine-readable and not practical
              for most users.

              has access, for one, multiple, or all Tracing Requests to which the user has access.
              In this export, each form is represented in its own tab within the XLS
              file. NOTE: The XLS format renders non-Latin characters (e.g. Arabic,
              Bangla) in a readable format, while the CSV export does not.'
            label: Excel (XLS file) export
          flag:
            explanation: Ability to add a flag to a tracing request. Users with this
              permission can also remove the flags that they have added to a tracing
              request.

            label: Resolve any Flag
          import:
            explanation: Allows the user to create one or more new cases by importing
              them from a CSV, Excel, or JSON file. The imported file must be formatted
              *very* specifically for information to be imported properly. This function
              should only be available for administrative users with advanced technical
              skills and an in-depth knowledge of how data is formatted in Primero.
              Only performed from case list page.
            label: Import
          manage:
            explanation: Allows a user to perform all available actions on tracing
              requests. The "Manage" permission essentially means "everything".
            label: Manage (all permissions for this resource type)
          read:
            explanation: Ability to view a tracing request. Roles with the ability
              to see tracing requests should also have the ability to see the Potential
              Match record type.
            label: View

        label: Tracing Request
      transfer:
        actions:
          transfer:
            explanation: This means the role will appear as an option for "Type of
              Recipient" when the user performs an external referral. If the user
              chooses this role as the type of transfer, the export which Primero
              generates when the user submits the transfer will only contain information
              which is found in the forms this role has access to. So, for instance,
              if the user chooses "Medical Service Provider" as the type of recipient,
              and the Medical Service Provider role only has access to the Basic Identity
              and Protection Concerns forms, the export file which Primero exports
              for the external transfer will only contain the fields which are in
              those two forms.
            label: Can this role be used for external transfers?
        label: Transfer
      user:
        actions:
          agency_read:
            explanation: Ability to see only those user accounts in the current user's
              agency. This also affects which user accounts the current user can perform
              other actions on. For instance, if the current user has the "Write"
              permission on users, but also has the Agency Read permission, they will
              only be able to edit user accounts which are in their own agency. Similarly,
              if the current user has the "Manage" permission on users, but has the
              "Agency Read" permission, they will only be able to create users for
              their own agency.
            label: View (Within Agency)

            label: Manage (all permissions for this resource type)
          read:
            explanation: Ability to see user accounts. By default, every user has
              the ability to see and edit information about their own user account
              (e.g. password, email).
            label: View
          write:
            explanation: Ability to click the "Edit" button on the show user page,
              update information about the user, and then save. Please note that this

      user_group:

          assign:
            explanation: Ability to pick user groups when creating or editing a user
              account. Please note that if the current user has the "only records
              or users in my group" level of access, they will only be able to select
              one or more of *their own* user groups for the user account that they
              are creating or editing. This means that a manager with the ability
              to assign user groups would only be able to add a user to user groups
              the manager currently belongs to. This permission is necessary for any
              role which will be creating or editing user accounts.
