                Users can see disabled cases in the case list by using a filter. Since Primero does not allow users to delete
                cases, a user may wish to disable a case as a substitute. For instance, if a user created a case by mistake,
                or the case has bad data, the user should disable it."

                have added to a case."
          incident_from_case:
            label: "Create an incident from a case"
            explanation: "This permission allows the user to click the \"Create Incident\" button. This generates an incident
                which may contain some information copied over from the case. For GBV cases, this button is at the top of
                the show case page, and corresponds to information about the case as a whole. In some incident-tracking
                contexts, this button is on an \"Incident Details\" subform. In this situation, some information may be copied
                from the incident details subform where the button was clicked, as well as from the case as a whole. I.e.
                the new incident created may contain the field \"Type of Violence\" from the individual incident details subform,
                but may also contain the age and sex of the case itself. Note that this permission also allows the user to
                see a link to the incident which was created."
          incident_details_from_case:
            label: "Add Incident Details to another user's case from search results page"
            explanation: "Ability to add an entry for the Incident Details subform on a case you have found in search results,
                but to which you do not have access. The user performs this action from the search results page by selecting
                one or more cases, then selecting \"Add Incident\" from the actions menu. The user then sees a modal containing
                all the fields on the Incident Details subform, where they can enter and submit information about a service.
                Because this action can only be performed from the search results page, it only makes sense for a role to
                have this permission if they also have the \"Search for case records owned by other users\" permission."
          service_provision_incident_details:

            explanation: "Allows the user to see a button labelled \"Save and Add Service Provision\" at the bottom of the
                Add Incident modal. Clicking this button saves the information currently entered about the incident, and
                then takes the user directly to the Add Service Provision modal. Because this action is directly linked to
                the Add Incident and Add Service Provision actions, it only makes sense to give this permission to a role
                if that role also has the \"Add Incident Details to another user's case\" and \"Add Service provision to another
                user's case\" permissions."
          services_section_from_case:
            label: "Add Service provision to another user's case"

                modal containing all the fields on the Services subform, where they can enter and submit information about
                a service. Because this action can only be performed from the search results page, it only makes sense for
                a role to have this permission if they also have the \"Search for case records owned by other users\" permission."

            label: "Export list view CSV"
            explanation: "User can generate a CSV file export from the case list page which contains the same fields which

                In this export, each form is represented in its own tab within the XLS file. NOTE: The XLS format renders
                non-Latin characters (e.g. Arabic, Bangla) in a readable format, while the CSV export does not."
          export_photowall:
            label: "Export Photowall"
            explanation: "Allows the user to export a file from the case list page which contains the photos of all cases selected.

                fields to which the current user has access, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access.
                In the PDF export file, information is listed first by case, and then further organized by the form on which
                information appears."
          export_duplicate_id_csv:
            label: "Export duplicates"
            explanation: "Creates a CSV export of cases which have the same National ID field (may have a different label,
                depending on the configuration). Only performed from case list page."
          export_json:
            label: "Export JSON"
            explanation: "User can generate a JSON file export from the case list or case show pages, which contains all
                fields to which the current user has access, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access.
                This export is mainly used for those who want to export cases from the current Primero system and then import
                them into a different Primero system, or into another information management system. The JSON format is
                machine-readable and not practical for most users."

            label: "Export custom"
            explanation: "User can generate a XLS file export from the case list or case show pages, which contains a custom
                set of forms or fields, for one, multiple, or all cases to which the user has access. In this export, each
                form is represented in its own tab within the XLS file. The user can select which forms or fields they want
                included in the export using the Custom Export modal. Please note that users can only include forms and
                fields in the export if they already have the ability to see those forms and fields when viewing a case
                in the application."
          import:
            label: "Import"
            explanation: "Allows the user to create one or more new cases by importing them from a CSV, Excel, or JSON file.
                The imported file must be formatted *very* specifically for information to be imported properly. This function
                should only be available for administrative users with advanced technical skills and an in-depth knowledge
                of how data is formatted in Primero. Only performed from case list page."
          consent_override:
            label: "Override lack of consent when referring or transferring"
            explanation: "Allows the user to perform a referral or transfer for a case which has not provided consent."
          sync_mobile:
            label: "Sync with mobile device"
            explanation: "This permission generally allows the user to use the mobile application. First, it allows the user
                to see the \"Mark for Mobile\" and \"Un-mark for Mobile\" actions, which appear on the case list and case
                show pages. Marking a case for mobile indicates that information about that case should be synced between
                the user's mobile device and the web application, while un-marking a case for mobile stops this syncing
                from happening. Users without this permission also cannot sync their mobile devices with the web application
                in general, meaning that they cannot use the mobile app to manage cases."
          request_approval_bia:
            label: "Request %{approval_label} approval"
            explanation: "Allows a user (usually a case worker) to request that their manager approve their case's %{approval_label}."

          search_owned_by_others:
            label: "Search for case records owned by other users"
            explanation: "Allows a user to perform a search for records which they would not usually have access to, either
                because they are not the record owner for that case, or (for managers) because the record owner is not in
                their user groups. Note that, while the user will see the case in the search results view, they will not
                be able to click into the case show page for that case, meaning they will not be able to see any detailed
                information about the case."
          display_view_page:
            label: "Display View Page"
            explanation: "If a user performs a search for a case to which they do not have access, this permission allows
                them to see a small modal with basic information about the case, even if the user cannot click into the
                case to see all of its information. The fields which appear in this \"View Modal\" are fields which have
                been configured to \"Show on Short Form.\" This modal is also useful for users performing Family Tracing
                and Reunification actions, since the \"View Modal\" is available for the user to access when they are reviewing
                cases which have appeared as \"Potential Matches\" for a Tracing Request."
          request_transfer:
            label: "Request Transfer"
            explanation: "Reveals the \"Request Transfer\" button on the \"View Modal\". The button allows the user to send
                a message with a personalized note via email to the current record owner of a case, requesting that the
                record owner transfer the case to the user who sent the request. This is useful in contexts where children
                change locations often, and case workers need a child's previous case worker to send information about the
                child to avoid the creation of a duplicate record."
          view_photo:
            label: "View Photo from case list view"
            explanation: "Allows a user to see a case's photos from the case list view. Without this permission, the user
                does not see the \"Photo\" column of the case list table, or the photo icons which appear there. This permission
                also allows the user to see photos of the child in the \"View Modal\"."
          referral_from_service:
            label: "Refer Case from Service subform"
            explanation: "Allows the user to see the \"Refer\" button on the Services subform. When the user clicks this

                the user clicked the Refer button."
          add_note:
            label: "Add Notes to a case"
            explanation: "Allows a user to add an entry into the \"Notes\" subform (also sometimes called \"Comments\").
                The user does this by clicking the \"Add Notes\" button onthe case show page. This action is particularly
                useful for managers who do not have the ability to edit cases, but want to add reminders to a case for the
                case worker. In this way, adding a note is similar to adding a flag. The advantage of adding a note is that,
                when the manager adds a note to a case, a notification will appear on the case for the case worker when
                they are viewing the case on their mobile device."
          find_tracing_match:
            label: "Find tracing match from case"
            explanation: "This is used exclusively for contexts with Family Tracing and Reunification activity. Users with
                this permission will see a \"Find Tracing Match\" button on the case show page. When they click it, they
                will arrive at a list of tracing requests in the system which are potential matches for their case."
          assign:
            label: "Assign"
            explanation: "Allows a user to send a case from its original record owner to any other user in the system. No
                child consent is needed for this action. Unlike with transfers, the recipient is not given the chance to
                accept or reject the assignment."
          assign_within_agency:
            label: "Assign to user within my agency"
            explanation: "Allows a user to send a case from its original record owner to any other user in the current user's

          remove_assigned_users:
            label: "Remove other assigned users (taking back case access from referred-to users)"
            explanation: "Allows the user to remove other users from the \"Other Assigned Users\" field. A user is listed
                here if they have received a referral for the case or have received a transfer for the case, but have not
                yet accepted or rejected it. When you remove a user from the \"Other Assigned Users\" field, you remove
                their access to the case. So, users with this permission can remove case access from users who have previously
                received referrals or still-pending transfers for the case. Note that this permission only works if the
                current user also has the ability to edit the case."
          transfer:
            label: "Transfer"
            explanation: "Allows a user to send a case from its current record owner to any user in the system with the
                ability to receive transfers. The record owner of the case does not change, however, until the recipient
                of the transfer \"accepts\" it. If the recipient instead \"rejects\" the transfer, the recipient loses access
                to the case, and it keeps its original record owner."

            explanation: "Allows a user to temporarily give access to a case to another user. The recipient of the referral
                will be able to perform all the same actions on the referred case as they would be able to perform on their
                own cases. When the recipient no longer needs access to the case, they can click the \"Done\" button in the
                Referrals and Transfers subform, and they will lose access to the case. You can only refer a case to a user
                whose role has the ability to receive referrals."

            label: "Receive Referral"
